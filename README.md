## Description
FidoFriendly helps dog owners, dog lovers, and their furry friends find dog-friendly establishments in their area. Rather than searching through endless Google Reviews, Yelp listings, or calling ahead, FidoFriendly brings all of the relevent dog-friendly information into one simple app. FidoFriendly makes it easy to plan a day out with your dog or bring her along for happy hour!

Users can enter an address and a list of dog-friendly bars, restaurants, retail establishments and other pet services returns. You can even keep track of your favorites with the "Saved Places" feature.

FidoFriendly utilizes the FourSquare [Places API](https://location.foursquare.com/developer/docs/places-api) to fetch data. This app is built around the MVC pattern for increased readability, separation of concerns, and the potential to scale up in the future. 

### Future Development
This project will soon feature visual searches (using maps), and return images with along with the current location details. Check back for updates and new features. Further design work is needed, and design libraries will be implemented as well.

## Installation
FidoFriendly can be run on iOS Simulator. To install it, simple download this repository, open ```FidoFriendly.xcodeproj``` in Xcode. Launch the app with ```command R``` or the Play button near the top left corner of the toolbar.
FidoFriendly is not currently available to run otherwise.

### Want to Help?
Though I have some experience with JavaScript and the MERN stack, I am 100% self-taught when it comes to Swift! This is the first Swift project I built start to finish, and also the first time I've used certain libraries, like CoreData.
Do you see something I missed or a more succint and effective way this code can be written? Great! Please reach out and let me know how I can improve. Thanks in advance for your tips, tricks, and pointers!

## Acknowledgements
The Apple documentation was (of course) incredibly helpful, as was the Swift 5 manual. Apple's documentation is relatively easy to understand and quite comprehensive! But there's a lot more to development than simply understanding the documentation.

I'd like to thank the contributors StackOverflow, Apple's Developer forum, and too many Youtube channels to count. In particular, I found the YouTube channel [iOS Academy](https://www.youtube.com/@iOSAcademy) and [the blog](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) particularly helpful in getting through this project!

Finally, I dedicate this effort to my own pooch, Sugar, who hates to stay home and loves to come with.
